# Poker-DSS-TFT-helper-prototype
I am working on GUI which will help player to pick one card, when player has 4 cards and want to draw one from 5 random cards to get best comp in poker. It will help me to make Teamfight Tactics helper in the near future.

I know my code is messy and need refactory, but I think its better to write software that works than giving up after one chapter from book.
This project will help me to get some experience as a software developer.

I dont recommend using it as a Poker helper because its only a few of rules from this game.
I will use it as a prototype for my main project which is Teamfight Tactics game from Riot helper.

I want to add fuzzy logic which will help me to use my knowledge about game to give to the user best advices what should he do next.

On the first stage the Decisive Support System will help you to pick new champions to your pool.
The user is going to use GUI to give DSS info about what is going on at the his own battlefield, mostly about his current champion pool.




Future if i dont give up.
In the next stages I want to add Neural Network as a sensor which will replace user in collecting info about battlefield.
Also I am thinking about using match history as a brain of DSS.
Or at the end I will prepare bot playing TFT.
